Creating a Hip Hop Graph

tl;dr

The focus of this project is creating a graph of hip hop artists based on the similarity between artists.  Various information retrieval, NLP, and dimensionality reduction techniques were used to arrive at these artist relationships, and TensorFlow's t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE) projector was used to create 2- and 3-D graphs for the genre.  The dataset used is one of the most comprehensive open-source lyrics datasets, and is available from LyricFind.  

The features and graphs built in this work can be used to make recommendations, as well as provide a view into the complex relationships between artists and what makes them dis/similar. A high level summary of this work can be found in the ppt pdf, and full analysis along with data cleaning can be found in IPython notebook.

The original idea and analysis here is based on the pudding.cool article called "The Language of Hip Hop".

Don't hesitate to reach out with questions and enjoy the work!
