Creating a Hip Hop Graph

tl;dr

The focus of this project is creating a graph of hip hop artists, based on their closest cosine similarity to another artist.  Various information retrieval and NLP techniques were used to arrive at these artist relationships, and TensorFlow's tSNE projector was used to create 2- and 3-D graphs of each of the hip hop artists.  The dataset is one of the most comprehensive open-source lyrics datasets, and is available from LyricFind.  

A high level summary of this work can be found in the ppt pdf above, and full analysis along with data cleaning can be found in ipython notebook (also above) 

The original idea and analysis here is based on the pudding.cool article called The Language of Hip Hop.

Don't hesitate to reach out with questions and enjoy the work!
